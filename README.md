# iOS-UnitTestSample

This is just a sample project about writing unit test on iOS Application. In this sample, mocks are generated by [SwiftMock](https://github.com/MakeAWishFoundation/SwiftyMocky).
If you change any protocol, you have to generate new mocks. You can either use manual or watch mode to generate mock with SwiftMock. 


## Generate mocks

### manually:

Execture below command in your project directory before executing tests

```
Pods/Sourcery/bin/Sourcery.app/Contents/MacOS/Sourcery --config mocky.yml
```

### in watch mode: 

changed methods will be reflected in mocks, after generation of mock, by triggering:

```
Pods/Sourcery/bin/Sourcery.app/Contents/MacOS/Sourcery --config mocky.yml --watch
```


Donâ€™t forget to add Mock.generated.swift to your test target :) !!!
